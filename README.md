# Data Structure and Algorithm Practice

This repository contains implementation of basic yet **important** data structures and algorithms.
Getting myself more familiar with the underlying logic of these basic building blocks of computer programs has been the
incentive of creating this repository. 
_Algorithms Forth Edition_ by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne is my main reference book.
Current content involves:

## Array, List, Stack, Queue, Deque, etc
Implementation of these data structures has been achieved in my previous efforts. [CS61B](https://sp18.datastructur.es/)
by Josh Hug has been quite helpful for studying this part.
Code for implementation can be found from
